&lt;p>If you heard loud keyboard smashing on the weekend of December 5th…&lt;br>
yeah, that was probably us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PerfectRoot CTF 2025 went live, thousands of players stormed the gates, the Discord server transformed into a marketplace of panic and memes, and somewhere in the background I was praying the infra wouldn’t spontaneously combust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spoiler: it didn’t.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Miracles &lt;em>do&lt;/em> happen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>PerfectRoot CTF 2025 is officially in the books — and wow, what a ride.&lt;br>
This year’s event wasn’t just bigger… it was louder, faster, and way more chaotic in the best possible way.

&lt;p>In the endless expanse of the cyber realm, secrets rarely scream — they whisper. Steganography is the ancient art of these whispers: the delicate craft of hiding a truth so deeply that even when it is in plain sight, it remains unseen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where cryptography cloaks a message behind an unbreakable cipher, steganography conceals its very existence. A song that carries a confession in static.

&lt;h2 id="-prologue">🕯️ Prologue&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The screen flickered. No IP addresses to scan. No EXIF tags to scrub. No usernames to pivot from. Only a prompt:&lt;/p>

Trace back its true origin and describe in &lt;strong>three words&lt;/strong> that which is known to all yet unknown to all.”&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
