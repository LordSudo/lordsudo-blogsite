&lt;p>This week marked my return from a much-needed break spent doing the highly advanced technique known as &lt;em>touching grass&lt;/em>. After a busy year, I came back feeling relaxed, refreshed, and in a surprisingly good mental state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of easing in gently, I decided to jump straight back in and see how rusty I’d become.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Took me a whole 2 hours to remember the master password to my password manager before I could log in anywhere. Never change your password before a long break. I didnt even remember why I changed it in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Behind the Mayhem: My PerfectRoot CTF 2025 Recap</title><link>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/perfectrootctf2025/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/perfectrootctf2025/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-lights-camera-chaos">🎉 Lights, Camera, Chaos!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you heard loud keyboard smashing on the weekend of December 5th…&lt;br>
yeah, that was probably us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PerfectRoot CTF 2025 went live, thousands of players stormed the gates, the Discord server transformed into a marketplace of panic and memes, and somewhere in the background I was praying the infra wouldn’t spontaneously combust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spoiler: it didn’t.&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Miracles &lt;em>do&lt;/em> happen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>PerfectRoot CTF 2025 is officially in the books — and wow, what a ride.&lt;br>
This year’s event wasn’t just bigger… it was louder, faster, and way more chaotic in the best possible way. If last year was a warm-up jog, this year was a sprint uphill while juggling flaming Docker containers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marked by Dust - ADHoc Intel Walkthrough</title><link>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/markedbydust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/markedbydust/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-marked-by-dust">🕯️ Marked by Dust&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The Question says:&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="prologue--the-forgotten-door">Prologue — The Forgotten Door&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It began with silence.&lt;br>
No coordinates, no hints — only an image.&lt;br>
A sun-scorched door of ancient wood, framed in cracked earth, its texture heavy with history. It stared back at the solver like a memory half-recalled, daring them to look closer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dig Deeper Walkthrough - Dewald Roode Cybersecurity Hackathon 2025</title><link>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/digdeeper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/digdeeper/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-prologue-whispers-beneath-the-noise">🕳️ Prologue: Whispers Beneath the Noise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the endless expanse of the cyber realm, secrets rarely scream — they whisper. Steganography is the ancient art of these whispers: the delicate craft of hiding a truth so deeply that even when it is in plain sight, it remains unseen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where cryptography cloaks a message behind an unbreakable cipher, steganography conceals its very existence. A song that carries a confession in static. An image that smiles innocently while concealing a weapon beneath its pixels. A file that hums one story to the ear while hiding another for those patient enough to listen closer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3=crowd? - Bitwall CTF OSINT Walkthrough</title><link>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/3crowdwalkthrough/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/3crowdwalkthrough/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-3crowd">🕳️ 3=crowd?&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The screen flickered. No IP addresses to scan. No EXIF tags to scrub. No usernames to pivot from. Only a prompt:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“All through time, we have strived to achieve precision in all our workings.&lt;br>
Come our beloved cyberspace, and nothing became one of the most important fundamentals of the entire industry.&lt;br>
Trace back its true origin and describe in &lt;strong>three words&lt;/strong> that which is known to all yet unknown to all.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CyberDefenders: 3CX Supply Chain Attack</title><link>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/3cxlab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lordsudo.github.io/posts/3cxlab/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="prologue-the-quiet-before-the-storm">&lt;strong>Prologue: The Quiet Before the Storm&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the quietest moments of routine operations, danger often stirs. A trusted software update, something so mundane, becomes the entry point for a dark and malicious force. The &lt;strong>3CX Supply Chain Attack&lt;/strong>—an incident where trust was manipulated, and a seemingly harmless software update became a weapon of digital warfare. Prepare yourself, for the tale is one of hidden danger, covert movements, and the eerie calm before a storm. Let’s walk through this, step by step, through the veil of deceit and into the truth that lies beneath.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
